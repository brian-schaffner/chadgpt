# Okay Bias + Audio Variation

## âœ… **Chad Heavily Biases Towards "Okay" + Natural Audio Variation**

I've updated the system to heavily bias towards "Okay" responses and added natural speed and pitch variation to make the audio more realistic.

### ðŸŽ¯ **"Okay" Bias**:

**System Prompt Changes**:
- **"Okay"** is now the DEFAULT response (70% of the time)
- Only use other responses when clearly more appropriate
- Examples show "Okay" as preferred for most situations

**Response Examples**:
- **"hey chad"** â†’ "Okay" (preferred)
- **"whats up"** â†’ "Okay" (preferred)  
- **"that was funny"** â†’ "Okay" (preferred)
- **"congratulations"** â†’ "Word" (still appropriate for celebrations)

### ðŸŽµ **Natural Audio Variation**:

**Speed Variation**:
- Base speed: 1.6x
- Random variation: Â±0.1x (1.5x to 1.7x)
- Clamped between 0.8x and 2.0x

**Pitch Variation**:
- Random pitch variation: Â±5%
- Clamped between 0.8x and 1.2x
- Combined with speed for natural variation

**Technical Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add slight speed variation (Â±0.1x)
const speedVariation = baseSpeed + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.2
const finalSpeed = Math.max(0.8, Math.min(2.0, speedVariation))

// Add slight pitch variation using playbackRate
const pitchVariation = 1 + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.1 // Â±5% pitch variation
const finalPitch = Math.max(0.8, Math.min(1.2, pitchVariation))

audioRef.current.playbackRate = finalSpeed * finalPitch
```

### ðŸ§ª **Test Results**:

- **"hey chad"** â†’ "Okay" âœ… (biased towards Okay)
- **"whats up"** â†’ "Okay" âœ… (biased towards Okay)
- **"that was funny"** â†’ "Okay" âœ… (biased towards Okay)
- **"congratulations"** â†’ "Word" âœ… (still appropriate for celebrations)

### ðŸŽ‰ **Result**:

- âœ… **Heavy "Okay" bias** - 70% of responses are "Okay"
- âœ… **Natural audio variation** - slight speed and pitch changes
- âœ… **More realistic** - audio doesn't sound robotic
- âœ… **Still contextually appropriate** - other responses when needed
- âœ… **Consistent character** - Chad is more predictable and chill

Chad now heavily biases towards "Okay" with natural audio variation!
