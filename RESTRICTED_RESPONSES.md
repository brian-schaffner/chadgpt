# Restricted Response System

## âœ… **Chad Only Gives Responses with Audio**

I've updated the API to restrict Chad's responses to ONLY the 6 responses we have audio files for.

### ðŸŽµ **Allowed Responses**:

Chad can ONLY respond with these exact responses:
- **"All good"** â†’ plays `all good.mp3`
- **"Okay"** â†’ plays `okay.mp3`
- **"Sure"** â†’ plays `sure.mp3`
- **"Word"** â†’ plays `word.mp3`
- **"Haha"** â†’ plays `haha.mp3`
- **"Nah"** â†’ plays `nah.mp3`

### ðŸ”’ **System Restrictions**:

1. **API Level**: System prompt only allows the 6 responses
2. **Validation**: API validates responses and picks from allowed list
3. **Fallback**: If invalid response, randomly picks from allowed responses
4. **No Other Responses**: Chad cannot give any other responses

### ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**:

```typescript
// API validates response - only allow responses with audio files
const allowedResponses = ["All good", "Okay", "Sure", "Word", "Haha", "Nah"]
const cleanResponse = chadResponse.replace(/\.$/, '') // Remove trailing period

if (!allowedResponses.includes(cleanResponse)) {
  // If response is not in allowed list, pick one randomly
  chadResponse = allowedResponses[Math.floor(Math.random() * allowedResponses.length)]
}
```

### ðŸ§ª **Test It**:

Visit `http://localhost:3001/test-tts` and try any message. Chad will only respond with one of the 6 allowed responses, and each will play its corresponding audio file.

### ðŸŽ‰ **Result**:

- âœ… **Only 6 responses** - no other responses possible
- âœ… **Every response has audio** - no silent responses
- âœ… **Random selection** - variety in responses
- âœ… **Audio always plays** - every response triggers audio
- âœ… **Perfect sync** - audio files match responses exactly

Chad now only gives responses that have corresponding audio files!
